- https://appear.in/Pyladies-Boston-Django-Planning
- VM's, cloud9 recommended

instructions in tutorial: vagrant or c9
7 hours total

presentations from each

## goal: 
- /r/ schedule for day, timebox
- motivation vs 'look what I did', but knowing that ... they can do this and have something done
- goal: we should be going around answering questions therefore, unless
  extremly complicated, no presentation should be > 20 min /r/ things that are
  smaller... 5-10 minutes tops, with breakdowns in between
-  people should have basic knowledge of python, first half of learn python the
  hard way

- models should have what is an ORM, what is a database... assume very intro

## TODO:

-  join/follow meetup: https://www.meetup.com/PyLadies-Boston/events/231625139/ /r/ IRC
- @jk to survey: why are you taking the workshop, what do you want to get out.
- culture section? maybe
- this is at tufts -- what is internet access
- code editor, version of python

## C9?

- recommendation: use the c9 in browser, with default text editor
- c9 /r/ ccard. bitnami might too!


## I need to:

- covering templaates, important to cover template extending
- check doc, add google slides
- TODO: check out bitnami

Setup Notes:
  - "sudo apt get install python3.5" does not work on trusty
  - sign up for python anywhere
